## Project description

The game is a card game for newbies in the crypto space and can be played in groups of 2-6 players. It introduces the players to basic concepts around crypto currencies and reinforces best practices for holding your own crypto. 

The game is played with two types of cards: event cards and coin cards. The coin cards represent Bitcoin, Ethereum and a total of 20 altcoins and tokens. They also introduce the players to the concept of "shitcoin".

The event cards let you pick up or lose coin cards and introduce topics around security, blockchain related jargon, use cases and community culture.

## Game package

- total number of players: 2-6, maybe we should settle for 4 to make it less complicated?
- total number of cards in a Crypto Game package: 100
- total number of each type of card with all available characteristics: 

*50 coincards:*

- 4 BTC (10 points each)
- 6 ETH (5 points each)
- 20 unique altcoins/tokens (3 points each), each associated to one of the 5 use cases (makes groups of 4 for every use case)
- 20 generic shitcoins (1 point each)
- 10 “not your keys, not your coins” cards 
- 10 wallet cards
- 2 “lost your seed” cards
- 21 general knowledge cards that let you pick up 1 coin card
- 2 mining/staking cards, you need to own at least one PoW/PoS coin to pick up 2 coin cards
- 5 use case cards, you need to own at least one of 4 coins associated with the use case to pick up 3 coin cards. The use cases and their associated coins are:

-- Medium of exchange: BCH, DOGE, LTC, XMR
-- Smart contract platform: DOT, ADA, ATOM, SOL
-- DeFi: AAVE, UNI, AVAX, LUNA
-- Web3: FIL, LINK, THETA, GRT

## Game mechanics

### Game setup:

4 players receive 6 coincards, that lay open on the table (this is the portfolio) and 3 event cards that they hold covered in their hand (if only 2 players, they receive 8 coin cards each).
On the table are two covered stacks with the remaining coin cards and remaining event cards.

### Game round:

In each round the player whose turn it is first picks up an event card and then chooses which of their 4 event cards to play (so he ends up with 3 cards in his hand). 

They have 6 options to play:

- If he plays a knowledge card, the card is put down open on a pile next to the event card stack and he can pick up 1 new coin card from the stack and add it to his portfolio (ideally he reads out loud the info on the card)
- If he plays a mining/staking card, the card is put down open on a pile next to the event card stack and if he already owns a PoW (or PoS) coin card, he can pick up 2 new coin cards from the stack and add them to his portfolio
-If he plays a use case card, the card is put down open on a pile next to the event card stack and if he owns at least 1 coin card of the relevant use case, he can pick up 3 new coins from the stack and add them to his portfolio.
-If he plays a wallet card, he lays it on the table in front of him and adds a coin card of his choice on top (letting the wallet a little bit visible). This card is now “in” the wallet and therefore protected from being taken with a “not your keys, not your coins” card.
All other players who have a wallet card in front of them can now add 1 coin card of their choice to protect in their wallet. If you don’t have a wallet card on the table you can’t protect any cards.
- If he plays a “not your keys, not your coins” card, the card is put down open on a pile next to the event card stack and the player next in turn has to give up 3 unprotected coin cards from his portfolio. The player can choose which coins he gives up. If he has less than 3 unprotected cards, he just gives up all of them. Shitcoin cards lost this way, leave the game. All other coin cards go to a pile next to the coin card stack.
- If he plays a “lost your seed” card, one of his immediate neighbours has to give up a wallet and all of its contents. The player whose turn it is, can choose which of his two neighbours is going to be affected and which of their wallets they have to give up. Shitcoin cards lost this way, leave the game. All other coin cards go to a pile next to the coin card stack.The wallet card goes to the pile next to the event card stack.

### Game end and winning:

When one of the two stacks on the table runs out, the pile next to it gets shuffled and is used as the new stack. The game ends when there are no coin cards left in the stack. The winner is the player who amassed the most points in his portfolio (all wallets and all unprotected coins together).
