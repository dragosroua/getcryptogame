## Game mechanics

### Game setup:

4 players receive 6 coincards, that lay open on the table (this is the portfolio) and 3 event cards that they hold covered in their hand (if only 2 players, they receive 8 coin cards each. 3 players get 7 cards, etc.).
On the table are two covered stacks with the remaining coin cards and remaining event cards.

### Game round:

In each round the player whose turn it is first plays one of the event cards in their hand and then picks up a new event card (so he ends up with 3 cards in his hand). 

They have 7 options to play:

- If he plays a knowledge card, the card is put down open on a pile next to the event card stack and he can pick up 1 new coin card from the stack and add it to his portfolio (if playng with a physical deck, he reads out loud the underlined word on the card, if he fogets, someone else can read it instead and capture the coin card bounty for themselves)
- If he plays a mining/staking card, the card is put down open on a pile next to the event card stack and if he already owns a PoW (or PoS) coin card, he can pick up 2 new coin cards from the stack and add them to his portfolio
- If he plays a use case card, the card is put down open on a pile next to the event card stack and if he owns at least 1 coin card of the relevant use case, he can pick up 3 new coins from the stack and add them to his portfolio (if playng with a physical dec and he does not have any of the necessary coin cards in his portfolio, he can strike a deal with somene who does, splitting the bounty as negociated )
- If he plays a wallet card, he lays it on the table in front of him and adds two coin cards of his choice on top (letting the wallet a little bit visible). These cards are now “in” the wallet and therefore protected from being taken with a “not your keys, not your coins” card. A playaer can have as many wallets as they want, one wallet can contain  a maximum of 3 cards.
All other players who have a wallet card in front of them can now add 1 coin card of their choice to protect in any of their wallets that contains less than 3 cards. If you don’t have a wallet card on the table you can’t protect any cards.
- If he plays a “not your keys, not your coins” card, the card is put down open on a pile next to the event card stack and the player next in turn has to give up 3 unprotected coin cards from his portfolio. The player can choose which coins he gives up. If he has less than 3 unprotected cards, he just gives up all of them. Shitcoin cards lost this way, leave the game. All other coin cards go to a pile next to the coin card stack.
- If he plays a “lost your seed” card, he can choose one player who has to give up one of their wallets and all of its contents. The player whose turn it is, can choose which of their wallets they have to give up. Shitcoin cards lost this way, leave the game. All other coin cards go to a pile next to the coin card stack.The wallet card goes to the pile next to the event card stack.
- If he plays a “hacked” card, he can choose one player who has to give up one of their coin cards from their portfolio. The player whose turn it is, can choose which. Shitcoin cards lost this way, leave the game. All other coin cards go to a pile next to the coin card stack.

### Game end and winning:

When one of the two stacks on the table runs out, the pile next to it gets shuffled and is used as the new stack. The game ends when there are no coin cards left in the stack. The winner is the player who amassed the most points in his portfolio (all wallets and all unprotected coins together).
