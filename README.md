## GetCrypto Game - A HackAtom VI project

The game is a card game for newbies in the crypto space and can be played in groups of 2-6 players. It introduces the players to basic concepts around crypto currencies and reinforces best practices for holding your own crypto.

The game is played with two types of cards: event cards and coin cards. The coin cards represent Bitcoin, Ethereum and a total of 20 altcoins and tokens. They also introduce the players to the concept of "shitcoin".

The event cards let you pick up or lose coin cards and introduce topics around security, blockchain related jargon, use cases and community culture.
